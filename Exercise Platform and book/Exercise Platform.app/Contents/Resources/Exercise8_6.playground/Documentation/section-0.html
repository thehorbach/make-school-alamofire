      <h3>8.6 Binary Search</h3>

<p>Searching a sorted collection is a common task. For example finding a word in a dictionary, or a number in a phone book.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">Binary search</a> is one of the fundamental algorithms in computer science. In its most basic form, binary search finds the position of an element, known as the search key, in a sorted array. It does this by repeatedly halving the search interval. Initially the search interval ranges from the first index of the array to the last index. In each step the algorithm compares the middle value from the search interval with the search key. If the middle value is less than the key, then all the value from the first half of the array are lower than the key, that means that the search key cannot be located in the first half, the search will continue in the second half of the array. The same logic will apply if the middle element is greater than the key. If the middle value is equal to the search key then the key has been found.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a few examples to understand the algorithm, <code>left</code> if the first index of the search interval and <code>right</code> is the last one:</p>

<pre><code class="code-example language-swift">numbers = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12] // 8 elements

---------------------------------------------------------------------
key = 4

// Step 1 (left = 0, right = 7)
// the middle element is 5 which is greater than 4
// the search will continue in the first half of the search interval

// Step 2 (left = 0, right = 3)
// the middle element is 2 which is less than 4
// the search will continue in the second half of the search interval

// Step 3 (left = 2, right = 3)
// the middle element is 4 - we found the key!

---------------------------------------------------------------------
key =  12

// Step 1 (left = 0, right = 7)
// the middle element is 5 which is less than 12
// the search will continue in the second half of the search interval

// Step 2 (left = 4, right = 7)
// the middle element is 8 which is less than 12
// the search will continue in the second half of the search interval

// Step 3 (left = 6, right = 7)
// the middle element is 9 which is less than 12
// the search will continue in the second half of the search interval

// Step 4 (left = 7, right = 7)
// the search interval has only one element which is equal to the key

---------------------------------------------------------------------
key = 3

// Step 1 (left = 0, right = 7)
// the middle element is 5 which is greater than 3
// the search will continue in the first half of the search interval

// Step 2 (left = 0, right = 3)
// the middle element is 2 which is less than 3
// the search will continue in the second half of the search interval

// Step 3 (left = 2, right = 3)
// the middle element is 4 which is greater than 3
// the search will continue in the first half of the search interval

// Step 4 (left = 2, right = 2)
// the search interval has only one element which is not equal to the key
// the key could not be found in the array
</code></pre>

<p>Implement the binary search function using recursion.</p>
